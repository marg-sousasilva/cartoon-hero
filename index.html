		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>This is the Cube. The cube is a shape with 4 sides, all the same, we would say pretty consistent. <br> 
			The cube is currently living in one of the coldest places of the world, so he has to protect himself with <br> 
			the help of unnamed shapes. The humans call it beanie, scarf and socks. It does make him warmer, so we would say <br> 
		it's a successful adaptation from this simple shape.</p>

		<h2>Friends</h2>
		<p>The cube usually hangs out with his favourite shapes: the circle and the triangle. All of them have very different shapes and functions, they are all made from different numbers relations, but in the end they all come to the same: having fun with eachother. Diversity is what makes them learn from eachother and together they are a great shape team.Above you can find their favourite songs.</p>
